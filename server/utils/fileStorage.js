// This file provides utilities for handling file uploads in Vercel's serverless environment
// For a production app, you would typically use a cloud storage service like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Cloudinary

/**
 * In a serverless environment like Vercel, we can't store files locally.
 * This is a placeholder for where you would implement cloud storage.
 * 
 * For a real implementation, you would:
 * 1. Install the appropriate SDK (e.g., aws-sdk for S3)
 * 2. Configure your cloud storage credentials
 * 3. Implement upload/download functions
 * 
 * Example with AWS S3 (you would need to install aws-sdk):
 * 
 * const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
 * const s3 = new AWS.S3({
 *   accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
 *   secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
 *   region: process.env.AWS_REGION
 * });
 * 
 * async function uploadFile(file, filename) {
 *   const params = {
 *     Bucket: process.env.AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME,
 *     Key: filename,
 *     Body: file.buffer,
 *     ContentType: file.mimetype
 *   };
 *   
 *   const result = await s3.upload(params).promise();
 *   return result.Location; // Return the URL of the uploaded file
 * }
 */

// For now, we'll use a simple Base64 encoding approach for demo purposes
// NOTE: This is NOT suitable for production as it will increase your database size significantly
// and is inefficient for large files

/**
 * Converts a file buffer to a data URL
 * @param {Buffer} buffer - The file buffer
 * @param {string} mimetype - The MIME type of the file
 * @returns {string} - The data URL
 */
function bufferToDataUrl(buffer, mimetype) {
  const base64 = buffer.toString('base64');
  return `data:${mimetype};base64,${base64}`;
}

/**
 * Processes a file upload and returns a URL or data representation
 * @param {Object} file - The uploaded file object from multer
 * @returns {string} - The URL or data representation of the file
 */
function processFileUpload(file) {
  if (!file) return null;
  
  // In a real app, you would upload to cloud storage here
  // For now, we'll use a data URL approach
  return bufferToDataUrl(file.buffer, file.mimetype);
